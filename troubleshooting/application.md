## Application Troubleshooting

- get all objects under a given namespace to get a glance on k8s objects deployed
- check if there are any restarts
- check if service name and ports are correct
- check if selectors used by svc are matching with pods selectors
- check if env variable in deployments and pods are correct
- check logs of pods for any error
